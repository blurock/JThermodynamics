	The Benson additivity method<sup>1</sup>, including its symmetry and steric
	corrections, gives an accurate estimation of the thermodynamic
	properties, Cp (at several temperatures), ΔH298 and ΔS298 of an
	arbitrary Lewis structure and is essential for automatic mechanism
	generation systems. THERGAS<sup>2</sup> and now its flexible and extensible
	descendent, JTHERGAS<sup>3</sup>, use an extensive database of individual atom
	bonding (Benson) structures for a first order estimation. Second order
	corrections are made with stearic hindrance, ring strain and internal
	and external symmetry contributions. Radical thermodynamics are
	computed as a disassociation reaction of the parent taking into account
	symmetry and vibrational differences between the parent and radical and
	a disassociation energy estimation. The significant design improvement
	of JTHERGAS is the extensible and easily manageable database of
	structures and corrections and the multiple interfaces to both the
	calculator and database. Extensibility is essential for computing the
	thermodynamics of new classes of species with new structural features
	such as in, for example, new fuels and biofuels.
