<title>Governing Principles</title>

<body>
	There are two governing principles of JTHERGAS extensibility and flexibility
	 are paramount. Extensibility is primarily achieved by having all
	molecular, atomic and structural information is encoded in a database
	and the fundamental calculational ‘engine’ of JTHERGAS does not have to
	be modified if new structures or corrections are to be introduced.
	Flexibility is achieved by coding all the 'rules', meaning how the thermodynamic corrections
	and additions are made, are based on 2D graphical representations coupled with tables of information.
	The elements making up the thermodynamic 'rule' are stored in the database.
	The 2D graphical representations determine if and where in the molecule the thermodynamic quantity is to be applied. 
	An associated table determines the numerical additions and corrections to the thermodynamics.
	
	<br> Access to the database and calculations with the database is
	not only platform independent (written in JAVA), but is also available
	through local line command, RESTful API's and this web interface. The
	molecular information is transmitted through the web interfaces using
	the standardized CML (Chemical Markup Language). Any programing
	language and platform that can access web-services can use the
	calculational facilities of JTHERGAS.
